# Talespire Dice Relay
## NO LONGER MAINTAINED
Send Foundry dice roll formulas to Talespire.

##  Installation
1. Under "Add-on Modules" click "Install Module"
2. Paste `https://github.com/DeVelox/talespire-dice/raw/main/module.json` into the "Manfiest URL" field
3. Click "Install"

## Notes
- Currently only compatible and tested with D&D5e and PF2e game systems.
- Not compatible with BetterRolls5e or anything not using core Foundry dice rolls.
- Players can configure the module to roll dice in Talespire, Foundry or both.
- Talespire currently doesn't support multiplication so for PF2e critical hits you need to roll damage normally then double it.
